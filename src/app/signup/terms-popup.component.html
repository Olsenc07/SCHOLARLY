      <p class="main-text">
        The University Of Toronto Varsity Blues is in no way affiliated with
        Scholarly and therefore holds no responsibility for the actions of their
        students using Scholarly. As well as any harm that may come to them by use
        of the app. This app is made by U Of T students for U Of T students and is
        only connected to U Of T by its student body, but in no way holds
        responsibility or connection for anything that happens because of the use
        of Scholarly. Like all social network platforms, Scholarly requires its
        members to act appropriately and to treat everyone with respect. Scholarly
        is not responsible for any misconducts, charges, lawsuits, or
        discrepancies between its members that may arise because of the use of the
        app Scholarly. Each member is responsible for their own actions and
        conduct and by agreeing to these conditions, agrees that they will in no
        way sue, charge, or in anyway put Scholarly responsible for the actions of
        its members. Scholarlieâ€™s purpose is to connect like minded individuals
        around the U Of T campus, allowing a large school to feel small while
        holding all the perks a large school carries.
