      "Terms and Conditions: The University Of Toronto Varsity Blues is in no
      way affiliated with Scholarly and therefore holds no responsibility for
      the actions of their students using Scholarly. As well as any harm that
      may come to them by use of the app. This app is made by U Of T students
      for U Of T students and is only connected to U Of T by its student body,
      but in no way holds responsibility or connection for anything that happens
      because of the use of Scholarly. Like all social network platforms,
      Scholarly requires its members to act appropriately and to treat everyone
      with respect. Scholarly is not responsible for any misconducts, charges,
      lawsuits, or discrepancies between its members that may arise because of
      the use of the app Scholarly. Each member is responsible for their own
      actions and conduct and by agreeing to these conditions, agrees that they
      will in no way sue, charge, or in anyway put Scholarly responsible for the
      actions of its members. Scholarlieâ€™s purpose is to connect like minded
      individuals around the U Of T campus, allowing a large school to feel
      small while holding all the perks a large school carries."
